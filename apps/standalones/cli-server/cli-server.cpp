/**
 * Protocol:
 *
 * Communication is done over stdin/stdout
 * Command spans at most one line
 * Every line either starts with a command keyword or it should be IGNORED and
 *      considered a comment
 * Input commands:
 *
 *      quit
 *          Kills the raw-jit-executor engine
 *
 *      prepare plan <plan_description>
 *          Prepares the plan described from the <plan_description>
 *          It will either result in an error command send back, or a result one
 *
 *          Valid plan descriptions:
 *
 *              from file <file_path>
 *                  Reads the plan from the file pointed by the <file_path>
 *                  The file path is either an absolute path, or a path relative
 *                  to the current working directory
 *
 *      execute plan <plan_description>
 *          Executes the plan described from the <plan_description>
 *          It will either result in an error command send back, or a result one
 *
 *          Valid plan descriptions:
 *
 *              from file <file_path>
 *                  Reads the plan from the file pointed by the <file_path>
 *                  The file path is either an absolute path, or a path relative
 *                  to the current working directory
 *
 *              from statement <label>
 *                  Executes the plan prepared for label <label>
 *
 *     echo <object_to_echo>
 *          Switched on/off the echoing of types of results. When switched on,
 *          in general, replies with the specific type of object that were
 *          to be written in files, are also echoed to stdout
 *
 *          Valid to-echo-objects:
 *              results (on/off)
 *                  Prints results in output as well.
 *                  Use with causion! Results may be binary or contain new lines
 *                  with keywords!
 *                  Default: off
 *
 * Output commands:
 *      ready
 *          Send to the client when the raw-jit-executor is ready to start
 *          receiving commands
 *      error [(<reason>)]
 *          Specifies that a previous command or the engine failed.
 *          The optional (<reason>) specified in parenthesis a human-readable
 *          explanation of the error. The error may be fatal or not.
 *      result <result_description>
 *          Specifies the result of the previous command, if any
 *
 *          Valid result descriptions:
 *              in file <file_path>
 *                  The result is saved in file pointed by the <file_path>
 *                  The file path is either an absolute path, or a path relative
 *                  to the current working directory
 *              echo
 *                  The following line/lines are results printed into stdout
